# Numbers greater than 5

This problem involves finding the number of integers with a value greater than 5. In Ruby speak, you could put it like this: Given an array, count how many items are greater than 5.

To solve this, you begin by outlining the logic, then translating it into code. An array is a collection of data.

For example:

Array = [17, 7, 3, 6, 10, 1]

First, you go through the entire array and ask if each number is greater than 5.

You then create a “count” variable by checking if each number has a value higher than 5. If it is, you count it, and if not, you don’t.
