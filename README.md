# Ruby Coding Dojo

[Doc with some helps](https://hackmd.io/KqltkU70SFG_MypXNOzYCw?view)

Coding Dojo is a meeting around a programming challenge where people are encouraged to participate and share their coding skills with the audience while they solve the problem.
One of the principles of the coding dojo is to create a safe, collaborative, non-competitive environment that brings together people with various skill levels, to test new ideas allowing continuous learning.


## Rules and principles of Coding Dojos

* The meeting will last 1 hour.
* At the beginning, the puzzle, procedure, and timebox should be discussed. This determines whether each participant can try out their own idea to solve the task or if there is a common approach.
* The puzzle can be chosen or drawn.
* Cooperation: The solution to the proposed problem is built with the cooperation of all participants, which creates a collaborative environment;
* Respect: All participants must respect the solution proposed by others, even knowing different ways to solve the problem. As the purpose is to learn, respect for each participant's time is fundamental;
* Simplicity: The objective is to share knowledge and experiences among participants. As each participant may be at a different technical level, it is important to keep both the problem composed and the implemented solution simple, so that everyone can understand exactly what is being done.

## Retrospective


At the end of the Coding Dojo, normally, participants conduct a retrospective of the event.

In this retrospective, which can be carried out using various techniques, three basic questions are generally answered:

* What we learned from today's Coding Dojo;
* What we can improve for the realization of the next Coding Dojos;
* What should we continue to do in the next Coding Dojos.
